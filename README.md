# Calendar-Planner
A calendar of the year that allows you to create reminders and plan your schedule throughout the course of the year

The program allows users to store any number of reminders for any day throughout the entirety of 2021, as well as a means to edit, delete, and view the information they are
saving.

When starting up the program, you will be presented with today's date, as well as a calendar of the current month which shows the current day in red. The screen will also present
the number of reminders for the month as well as for the day and provide buttons to navigate to view the calendar of the current month as well as the reminders listed in the
current day.

Each reminder is saved in the Reminders.txt file. A reminder can be created through the 'Add Reminder' Button, by selecting a date and entering the reminder's name as well as a
short explanation regarding the reminder. Each reminder also comes with a status, consisting of the 'No Status', 'Incomplete', and 'Completed' status, which can be changed. The
main screen also lists the number of total reminders that are listed as 'No Status', 'Incomplete', and 'Completed.'

You can click on the 'View Calendar' button to view the days of the year and the each reminder stored in each date. Clicking the button will present you with each month of the
year and the number of reminders in each month. Clicking on any month will present you with a calendar of the month. Each * in the calendar corresponds to one reminder in the day
that the * is present in. You can view any given day by clicking on the the day in the month. Screens for each day will present all the reminders for that day. A grey indicator
will show that the reminder's status is 'No Status. A green and a red indicator shows an 'Completed' and 'Incomplete' status respectively. Each reminder's status can be changed
and each reminder can be deleted. You are also able to view an entire week by clicking on the square at the end of the week on the month's screen, which will show every reminder
for that week in a color corresponding to the reminder's status. There are also 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons that helps you navigate each month and day and a 'Back' button.

Overall, I had a lot of fun doing this project. It seemed initially extremely difficult and the fact that I was able to finish it meant a lot to my confidence in my coding
abilities. This project was mainly for me to practice my GUI skills, but I wanted to create something that I could see myself using and had value.
